This plugin parses links and processes them to point to the right places. It is also needed for embedded links (like images). See [[Obsidian compatibility]] for more information.

> For information on how to add, remove or configure plugins, see the [[configuration#Plugins|Configuration]] page.

This plugin accepts the following configuration options:

- `markdownLinkResolution`: Sets the strategy for resolving Markdown paths, can be `"absolute"` (default), `"relative"` or `"shortest"`. You should use the same setting here as in [[Obsidian compatibility|Obsidian]].
  - `absolute`: Path relative to the root of the content folder.
  - `relative`: Path relative to the file you are linking from.
  - `shortest`: Name of the file. If this isn't enough to identify the file, use the full absolute path.
- `checkBrokenWikilinks`: Whether to check for broken wikilinks. Defaults to `true`.
- `onBrokenWikilink`: What to do with broken wikilinks. Can be `"disable"` (default), `"remove"`, or `"error"`.
  - `disable`: Keep the link as is, but add the `broken` class.
  - `remove`: Remove the link, leaving only the text.
  - `error`: Throw an error and stop the build.
- `prettyLinks`: If `true` (default), simplifies links by removing folder paths, making them more user friendly (e.g. `folder/deeply/nested/note` becomes `note`).
- `openLinksInNewTab`: If `true`, configures external links to open in a new tab. Defaults to `false`.
- `lazyLoad`: If `true`, adds lazy loading to resource elements (`img`, `video`, etc.) to improve page load performance. Defaults to `false`.
- `externalLinkIcon`: Adds an icon next to external links when `true` (default) to visually distinguishing them from internal links.

> [!warning]
> Removing this plugin is _not_ recommended and will likely break the page.
